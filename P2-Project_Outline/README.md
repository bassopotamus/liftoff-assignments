## Submission Instructions

### Overview

Name: D.Y.W.A.B.O.H.  OR  Reltor (not mis-spelled)

Our project is a web app that will allow a realtor to create, update and administer home listings. The app will provide search and filter capabilities so that a realtor can easily generate a potential properties list. The idea is influenced by our past experience getting suggested properties via email and a desire for a more organized way to handle them as both a realtor or a client.

### Features
1. Realtor Sign In/Sign Up - Realtors will be able to log in, either by creating accounts in the system, or by using a third-party authentication provider (e.g. Google Authentication). All access to the site will be restricted to logged-in users.
2. Create Property Entries - Realtors will be able to enter new listings by entering in a mixture of required (address, price, sq ft, etc) and optional fields (rooms list, image, description, etc)
3. Edit Property Entries - Realtors will be able to edit specific listing information, (eg, price, pictures, ownership status, etc.)
4. Delete Property Entries - Realtors can remove properties from their portfolio, for specific reasons.
5. Pull Property Data from Public API - Realtors can search for already-existing listings.
6. Search functionality - Searching current listings for specific criteria, (price ranges, time on market, zip code, school ratings etc)
7. Publish Curated Picture list for clients - Image-based dashboard for potential client listing.
